# Language Learning Speaker Selection Experiment

## Overview - The Challenge

At the core of our web-based experiment is a fundamental question: How do language learners' preferences for certain speakers influence their ability to learn new words? This project is designed to investigate the efficacy of personalized speaker selection in language acquisition.

## Motivation Behind the Experiment

What is the need for this application? Digital learning platforms offers a lot of opportunities for customized education paths, yet the impact of speaker selection on language learning remains underexplored. Our application bridges this gap, providing insights into how tailored language learning can enhance comprehension and retention.

## Core Features
